            <p>So what is anime?</p> 
            <p>The short answer is: Japanese animated shows.The long answer however is that <b> Anime is a  medium of art</b>.
                A way in which stories are told.
               Timeless stories, not restricted by age or gender. Anime is distinctly different from cartoons. 
               Anime contains some of the most creative story lines, worlds 
               and characters in media. Even books related to anime are dramatic and incredible, illustrated wonderfully with every page.
               Even art style and design in animes are extraordinarily beautiful.Each and every detail is designed intricately and just that
               gives the viewer an aesthetic experience.<img src="img/eyes.jpg" style="width:400px; margin:20px;"  class="float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail">
               <br><br>
              
               And what sets up anime as different to cartoons is that they tend to convey more complex and mature themes with their stories.
               Anime gives you a sense of belonging to a world of fantasies and for a brief period it helps you escape, live in another world.
               One day you could be fighting against 18 meter tall titans by using mechanical grappling hooks that let you jump higher and the next day you 
               could be battling evil wizards with powers  of your own or living through an apocalyptic wasteland or
               be living through a complex yet vivid high school life.Anything is possible in anime!</p>
            <img src="img/lv.jpg" class="img-thumbnail float-left img-fluid" style="height:300px;width: 500px;margin: 20px">
               
        
               
               
                <p> 
               Anime has something for just about everyone. It's full of beautiful things, scary things,pretty things and tragic things. 
               It pulls you into the story and sometimes makes you sleep with the light on, or will put you in a bad mood for the rest of the day. 
               But it is also full of humor and fun. That extreme change in thought can happen all in a single series--full of highs and lows.
               and that's why people watch anime. Despite the fact that some of it is about as far from real life as possible, 
               it reminds us of ourselves, and makes plays on reality giving people an escape from the constant every day routines in our lives.
               More than anything, it makes us feel something.</p>
               
               <p>Anime makes you fall in love with its characters.As the character develops through the story, you grow along with them.You can feel what they feel and can relate to them.
                   This makes you feel as if you're a part of that fantasy world.<img src="img/igif.gif" class="float-left img-fluid img-thumbnail" style="margin:20px;">
               
              
               It inspires people to be more childish and says its okay to be, even as an adult. Anime inspires imagination.
               It takes jokes too far or crushes our hearts with tragedies
               and does not apologize in the least when we laugh or cry--sometimes both for the same anime.<img src="img/cry.jpg" 
                                                                        style="width: 500px;margin: 20px" class="float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail">
               </p>
               <p> More than that, the deeper you dive into anime, the more you realize that you've joined a secret club of people who all have a similar interest.
               You can walk into a shoe store wearing an anime t-shirt and find yourself entrenched in an intense conversation 
               with a complete stranger (which has happened to me). It's like having a secret key to a bunch of friends you never 
               even knew you had. Since some of anime watchers are actually very shy people who are otherwise socially awkward, 
               having something to talk about with any group of people is part of what makes anime so attractive.</p>

               Thus, for people like me, anime is a way of life!<br><br>
